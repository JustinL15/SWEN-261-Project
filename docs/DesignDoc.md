## Executive Summary

This is a summary of the project.

### Purpose
>  _**[Sprint 2 & 4]** Provide a very brief statement about the project and the most
> important user group and user goals._

### Glossary and Acronyms
> _**[Sprint 2 & 4]** Provide a table of terms and acronyms._

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| SPA | Single Page |


## Requirements

This section describes the features of the application.

> _In this section you do not need to be exhaustive and list every
> story.  Focus on top-level features from the Vision document and
> maybe Epics and critical Stories._

### Definition of MVP
> _**[Sprint 2 & 4]** Provide a simple description of the Minimum Viable Product._

### MVP Features
>  _**[Sprint 4]** Provide a list of top-level Epics and/or Stories of the MVP._

### Enhancements
> _**[Sprint 4]** Describe what enhancements you have implemented for the project._


## Application Domain

This section describes the application domain.

![Domain Model](DomainAnalysis.png)

> The main interactions within our domain model take place through a customer's interactions with the store. <br>
> A **customer** will create an account and then browse the store's **inventory** which will display a collection of **product**. <br>
> The user can view existing **review** for each **product**, view **product** sorted by **category** as well as receive a **recommendation** for other products, this assists the user in making purchases. <br>
> Once the **customer** has decided to purchase a **product** they can add the item to their **cart** and continue to add more items until they are ready to purchase. <br>
> When purchasing, their **cart** will be moved to the **checkout** phase and all items will be marked as purchased and saved in an **order**. <br>
> The **customer** can then view the status of their **order**. <br>
> The **owner** can mark an **order** as complete, which will notify the **customer** that their order has been processed.


## Architecture and Design

This section describes the application architecture.

### Summary

The following Tiers/Layers model shows a high-level view of the webapp's architecture.

![The Tiers & Layers of the Architecture](architecture-tiers-and-layers.png)

The e-store web application, is built using the Model–View–ViewModel (MVVM) architecture pattern. 

The Model stores the application data objects including any functionality to provide persistance. 

The View is the client-side SPA built with Angular utilizing HTML, CSS and TypeScript. The ViewModel provides RESTful APIs to the client (View) as well as any logic required to manipulate the data objects from the Model.

Both the ViewModel and Model are built using Java and Spring Framework. Details of the components within these tiers are supplied below.


### Overview of User Interface

This section describes the web interface flow; this is how the user views and interacts
with the e-store application.

> _Provide a summary of the application's user interface.  Describe, from
> the user's perspective, the flow of the pages in the web application._


### View Tier
> _**[Sprint 4]** Provide a summary of the View Tier UI of your architecture.
> Describe the types of components in the tier and describe their
> responsibilities.  This should be a narrative description, i.e. it has
> a flow or "story line" that the reader can follow._

> _**[Sprint 4]** You must  provide at least **2 sequence diagrams** as is relevant to a particular aspects 
> of the design that you are describing.  For example, in e-store you might create a 
> sequence diagram of a customer searching for an item and adding to their cart. 
> As these can span multiple tiers, be sure to include an relevant HTTP requests from the client-side to the server-side 
> to help illustrate the end-to-end flow._

> _**[Sprint 4]** To adequately show your system, you will need to present the **class diagrams** where relevant in your design. Some additional tips:_
 >* _Class diagrams only apply to the **ViewModel** and **Model** Tier_
>* _A single class diagram of the entire system will not be effective. You may start with one, but will be need to break it down into smaller sections to account for requirements of each of the Tier static models below._
 >* _Correct labeling of relationships with proper notation for the relationship type, multiplicities, and navigation information will be important._
 >* _Include other details such as attributes and method signatures that you think are needed to support the level of detail in your discussion._

### ViewModel Tier
> _**[Sprint 4]** Provide a summary of this tier of your architecture. This
> section will follow the same instructions that are given for the View
> Tier above._

> _At appropriate places as part of this narrative provide **one** or more updated and **properly labeled**
> static models (UML class diagrams) with some details such as critical attributes and methods._
>

### Model Tier
The Model Tier consists of classes that represent our objects within the code. They are leveraged in the DAOs in order to save their data and keep persistence. They are also used by the controllers to process API requests.

#### Product
The product model represents an item that exists within the inventory. It tracks quantity and other information specific to the item.
![Product model](productModel.png)

#### Customer
The customer model allows representing a user and tying them to their cart and all existing orders. It also holds a password to allow login information.
![Customer model](customerModel.png)

#### Cart
The cart model saves a customer's cart so that it appears on consecutive logins. It stores a collection of products and their quantities. It is cleared once the checkout phase is completed.
![Cart model](cartModel.png)

#### Order
The order model saves a snapshot of products at the time of purchase as well as computes a total. This allows price changes in the future that will not impact past orders. A customer is tied to an order using the order ID.

## OO Design Principles
> _**[Sprint 2, 3 & 4]** Discuss at least **4 key OO Principles** in your current design. This should be taken from your work in "Adherence to Architecture and Design Principles" that you have completed in a previous Sprint. Be sure to include any diagrams (or clearly refer to ones elsewhere in your Tier sections above) to support your claims._

> _**[Sprint 3 & 4]** OO Design Principles should span across **all tiers.**_

## Static Code Analysis/Future Design Improvements
> _**[Sprint 4]** With the results from the Static Code Analysis exercise, 
> **Identify 3-4** areas within your code that have been flagged by the Static Code 
> Analysis Tool (SonarQube) and provide your analysis and recommendations.  
> Include any relevant screenshot(s) with each area._

> _**[Sprint 4]** Discuss **future** refactoring and other design improvements your team would explore if the team had additional time._

## Testing
> _This section will provide information about the testing performed
> and the results of the testing._

### Acceptance Testing
> _**[Sprint 2 & 4]** Report on the number of user stories that have passed all their
> acceptance criteria tests, the number that have some acceptance
> criteria tests failing, and the number of user stories that
> have not had any testing yet. Highlight the issues found during
> acceptance testing and if there are any concerns._

### Unit Testing and Code Coverage
> _**[Sprint 4]** Discuss your unit testing strategy. Report on the code coverage
> achieved from unit testing of the code base. Discuss the team's
> coverage targets, why you selected those values, and how well your
> code coverage met your targets._

>_**[Sprint 2 & 4]** **Include images of your code coverage report.** If there are any anomalies, discuss
> those._
